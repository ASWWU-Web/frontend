# The Mask

An online yearbook created by ASWWU for Walla Walla University using **Angular 5**.

Live version: [aswwu.com/mask](https://aswwu.com/mask/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Because the live version of the server is run at `aswwu.com/mask` you must build the project as follows.
```
ng build -prod --base-href /mask --deploy-url /mask
```
You can also run `npm run build`.
