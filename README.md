# Frontend

Aswwu's five sites all reside within this repository. Homepage, Mask, Jobs, Pages, and Elections. 

## Setup  
After you have cloned the repository, run `npm install` to install the necessary node modules.  
Once that has finished run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. This will add the necessary source files to the [shared-ng](https://github.com/ASWWU-Web/shared-ng) repository 

## Development server  
To run the development serve first navigate into the site's directory you wish to run.
`cd homepage`  
Then run the cmd `ng serve` to start the development server.  
Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
